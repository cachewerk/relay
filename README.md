## Installation

First, follow the [installation instructions](https://relay.so/docs/installation) to set up the Relay extension for PHP.

Next, either try the [Laravel](https://github.com/cachewerk/relay/tree/main/src/Laravel), [WordPress](https://objectcache.pro/docs/relay/) or [Magento](https://github.com/cachewerk/magento-relay) integrations.

Alternatively, grab the Composer package and run the benchmarks:

```bash
composer require cachewerk/relay
```

## Benchmarks

First set the `REDIS_HOST` and `REDIS_PORT` in the `phpbench.json`, then run the benchmarks:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:cachewerk/relay.git
cd relay
composer install

composer run bench
composer run bench:verbose
```

> Caveat 1: The results on ï£¿Silicon are misleading, run the benchmark on your actual x86 infrastructure.   
> Caveat 2: New Relic and similar profilers will significantly slow down Relay and skew the benchmarks.
